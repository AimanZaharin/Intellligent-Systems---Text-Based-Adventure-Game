<h1>Muslim Simulator 2023, A Text-Based-Adventure-Game</h1>

Our team has made the decision to develop a text-based adventure game concept. We chose the title “Muslim Simulator 2023” for our game. Muslim Simulator is a text-based adventure game where the choices made by the player has its consequences and will lead them  to  different  goal  state. It  is  an  Islamic-based  game  where  the  player  can  pick between good, bad, or neutral options. The game that we have created has a point system that allows players to gain, lose, or receive 0 points for any decision they make. We have implemented State Space Searchin our  gamewhichis the A* Search  Algorithm. The A* Search Algorithm is a variant of the Best-First Algorithm, centeredon employing heuristic methods to attain optimality and completeness. The term “optimality” refers to a search algorithm’s ability to always identify thebest  possibleanswer,  in  our  case,  the  least amount of path cost.
